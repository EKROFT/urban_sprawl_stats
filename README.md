# urban_sprawl_stats
Emily's MSc project statistics

Testing_Models.R: This is where I've been testing out possible models of all types that could be useful for this project. Largely a brainstorming/scratchpad document.

GAM_tutorial: This is a series of R scripts where I followed along with tutorials about GAMs to learn how to code for them.

shortlist_data_0715.csv: This is a version of the data where I removed 10% of the data for model fitting.

full_data_0710.csv: This is the complete dataset for this project. 

data_exploration.r: This is the file where I looked at my data for the first time to look for patterns. Mainly a brainstroming/scratchpad document. 

Testing_NO2_Possibilities: For this file I clipped the NO2 data to exclude all sites in the NE of Montreal to see what the NO2 patterns would look like without
the influence of the large petrochemical facility.

Models_to_Use.r: I organized the best models so far into a separate r script for ease of fidning them later.

spatial_testing.r: This is the script where I tested the data and models for spatial autocorrelation.

site_coords.gpkg / site_coords.shp: This is the GIS file containing the geographic coordinates for each study site (both gpkg and shp available).
