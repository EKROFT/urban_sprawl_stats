Emily's MSc project statistics

Testing_Models.R: This is where I've been testing out possible models of all types that could be useful for this project. Largely a brainstorming/scratchpad document.

GAM_tutorial: This is a series of R scripts where I followed along with tutorials about GAMs to learn how to code for them.

shortlist_data_0715.csv: This is a version of the data where I removed 10% of the data for model fitting.

full_data_0710.csv: This is the complete dataset for this project. 

data_exploration.r: This is the file where I looked at my data for the first time to look for patterns. Mainly a brainstroming/scratchpad document.
